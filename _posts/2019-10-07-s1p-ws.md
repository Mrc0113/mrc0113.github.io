#### Workshop Description: 
Are you passionate about building modern, distributed, real-time applications? Is your organization adopting an Event Driven Architecture to compete in our event-driven world? AsyncAPI is the industry standard for defining asynchronous APIs. Build and expand your developer toolbox by learning how to create event-driven microservices using Spring Cloud Streams, AsyncAPI and Solace PubSub+. And deploy those microservices using Pivotal’s Cloud Platform to allow for continuous delivery and agility in hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

Solace PubSub+ is an advanced event broker used by some of the largest enterprises in the world to process many billions of messages with low latency and high performance every day. It is available as a run-anywhere software, purpose-built hardware, and a managed service. Connect your Brokers to form your Event Mesh and dynamically route events across hybrid and multi-cloud environments using open standards such as MQTT, AMQP, JMS, REST, and of course our Spring Cloud Streams Binder!

In this hands-on workshop, attendees will be guided through a CodeLab where they will:
Discover how Spring Cloud Streams (SCS) enables developers to create highly scalable, event-driven applications.
Combine Spring Cloud Streams & AsyncAPI Code Generation to see how easy event-driven development is becoming.
Effortlessly deploy those microservices using a PubSub+ Event Mesh and Pivotal’s Cloud Platform to achieve event-driven, multi-cloud nirvana.
